BugList
=======

1. Editor problems:
	1. done - Bad error msg "error: error 1110402: Error: invalid condition..." - doesn't terminate either
	2. done - pressing { key - Console cannot print { - what other characters? - create unit test - fix MxConsole calls console.write(msg) if args.length == 0
	3. done - TextEditView doesn't display null lines returned by model.ChapterBody.GetEditAreaLinesForDisplay(EditAreaHeight) so any deleted line at bottom is not overwritten as presented by
		done - enter parabreak at end of chapter and then delete - the line isn't refreshed - home, end shows it has been deleted from TextLines
	    done - same as delete line doesn't redraw lines below
		done - Error 1110402 BaseView.DisplayLine() throws an exception so returns null - happens when no final parabreak and empty bottom line
	4. done - MxConsole.Setup() - doesn't report exception - fixed as a consequence of error handling refactoring
	5. done - now default to the same directory as assembly - appsettings.json and KLineEdCmd.json must be in the same directory as d:\test\mytest.ksx
	6. done - Clear ErrorState when switching views - startup press F10 (warning error incorrect char) press F2 moves but TextEditingView but error still displayed
	7. done - Incorrect char in PropsEdit produces a warning, but an error in TextEditing view
	8. done - Ctrl+Q takes a long time in PropsEdit 
	9. Filename in props doesn't update/change as filename itself is changed
	10. Changing --display cols=25 results in some lines not being truncated by SplitLongLine()
		- stops splitting at fifth line (E)
		    - Refresh() - LeftJustifyLinesInParagraph may insert lines into TextLines[] so while (row < GetTextLines()) ??? - possibly not an issue
			   end of LeftJustifyLinesInParagraph doesn't add the remaining oversized line as a collection of lines - i.e. TextLines[] still same size - InsertLine never called
	11. Terminate without save if already saved - Session - Duration: 00:00:00, but possibly Typing pauses: 08:24:24,101;08:26:08,67;08:27:21,72;[end]
		- fix - 


3. Raise bug for irregular cursor flashing, https://github.com/microsoft/terminal and stack exchange
4. Console problems:
	1. Always works when run in release/debug from VS2017 or VS2019, but sometimes crashes when run from Cmd Prompt in non-legacy mode, particularly if window width altered 
		- something to do with Setting Console.BufferSize, Console.WindowSize, Console.WindowTop and Console.WindowLeft Cmd Prompt
		see https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/3374
5. Unit test problem - need to run from command console or debug all tests
     https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/178
	 https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/803059/update-to-vs2019-some-tests-now-fail-when-run-from.html
6. rc.SetResult() not called - generate meaningful error message - see MxReturnCode todo list
