BugList
=======

1. System or third-party problem
	a. MxReturnCode
		 i) rc.SetResult() not called - generate meaningful error message - see MxReturnCode todo list
	b. Console:
	     i) Raise bug for irregular cursor flashing, https://github.com/microsoft/terminal and stack exchange
		ii) Always works when run in release/debug from VS2017 or VS2019, but sometimes crashes when run from Cmd Prompt in non-legacy mode, particularly if window width altered 
		- something to do with Setting Console.BufferSize, Console.WindowSize, Console.WindowTop and Console.WindowLeft Cmd Prompt
		see https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/3374
	c. VS2019 
		 i) Unit test problem - need to run from command console or debug all tests - VS2019 Test Runner doesn't support Console properly
