BugList
=======

1. Editor problems:
	1. Changing --display cols=25 results in some lines not being truncated by SplitLongLine()
	2. pressing { key
	3. Error 1110402 BaseView.DisplayLine() throws an exception so returns null - happens when no final parabreak and empty bottom line
	4. Bad error msg "error: error 1110402: Error: invalid condition..." - doesn't terminate either
	5. MxConsole.Setup() - doesn't report exception 
2. Console problems:
	1. Always works when run in release/debug from VS2017, but sometimes crashes when run from Cmd Prompt in non-legacy mode, particularly if window width altered 
		- something to do with Setting Console.BufferSize, Console.WindowSize, Console.WindowTop and Console.WindowLeft Cmd Prompt
		see https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/3374
3. Install problems:
	1. appsettings.json (and KLineEdCmdApp.json) must be in the same directory as d:\test\mytest.ksx
