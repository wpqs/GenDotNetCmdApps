BugList
=======

1. Editor problems:
	1. done - Bad error msg "error: error 1110402: Error: invalid condition..." - doesn't terminate either
	2. done - pressing { key - Console cannot print { - what other characters? - create unit test - fix MxConsole calls console.write(msg) if args.length == 0
	3. done - TextEditView doesn't display null lines returned by model.ChapterBody.GetEditAreaLinesForDisplay(EditAreaHeight) so any deleted line at bottom is not overwritten as presented by
		done - enter parabreak at end of chapter and then delete - the line isn't refreshed - home, end shows it has been deleted from TextLines
	    done - same as delete line doesn't redraw lines below
		done - Error 1110402 BaseView.DisplayLine() throws an exception so returns null - happens when no final parabreak and empty bottom line
	4. MxConsole.Setup() - doesn't report exception 
	5. appsettings.json (and KLineEdCmdApp.json) must be in the same directory as d:\test\mytest.ksx
	6. Changing --display cols=25 results in some lines not being truncated by SplitLongLine()

3. Raise bug for irregular cursor flashing, https://github.com/microsoft/terminal and stack exchange
4. Console problems:
	1. Always works when run in release/debug from VS2017 or VS2019, but sometimes crashes when run from Cmd Prompt in non-legacy mode, particularly if window width altered 
		- something to do with Setting Console.BufferSize, Console.WindowSize, Console.WindowTop and Console.WindowLeft Cmd Prompt
		see https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/3374
5. Unit test problem - need to run from command console or debug all tests
